# Diego Parra — Cybersecurity | Threat Intel | AI | Geopolitics

Security Analyst by trade, threat hunter by instinct, and researcher into the edges of what’s next.

I lead incident response and participate in threat hunting & detection at an enterprise level while pursuing deeper questions about how threats evolve - from ransomware gangs to token exploits, nation-state APTs to algorithmic manipulation. My work blends traditional security operations with forward-looking exploration into blockchain security, cryptocrime, AI, and geopolitical risk.
