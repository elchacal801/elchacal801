# 👾 Diego Parra — Cybersecurity | Threat Intel | Blockchain Risk | AI | Geopolitics

Security Analyst by trade, threat hunter by instinct, and researcher into the edges of what’s next.

I lead incident response and cyber risk efforts at an enterprise level while pursuing deeper questions about how threats evolve - from ransomware gangs to token exploits, nation-state APTs to algorithmic manipulation. My work blends traditional security operations with forward-looking exploration into blockchain security, cryptocrime, AI, and geopolitical risk.

- **Security Logging & SIEM Strategy** – building enterprise coverage across cloud, endpoints, and critical applications
- **Blockchain & Crypto Risk** – researching exploit patterns, dark market behaviors, and DeFi attack surfaces
- **AI for Security & Analysis** – building LLM pipelines to parse threat data, automate triage, and simulate adversary behavior
- **Geopolitical Intelligence** – exploring how cybercrime, monetary policy, and digital sovereignty intersect
- **DarkAnalytica** – a new platform at the crossroads of cybercrime, threat intelligence, OSINT, geopolitics, and investigative journalism.
